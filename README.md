# RenderBoy
[RenderBoy](https://github.com/LittleNate-Dev/RenderBoy) is a simple real-time renderer that allows you to load models and render them with various visual effects.

RenderBoy is still under development, and I haven't got time to write a proper README (Once I finished the development of v1.0, I'll write one).

If you have any issue, please send me emails, thank you :)
